Latvian A2 Mock Exam: Creation Using GenAI Tools and LLMs

A Latvian A2 mock exam is designed to assess elementary-level language skills, focusing on reading, writing, listening, and speaking. The A2 level corresponds to the ability to understand and use basic Latvian in everyday situations, such as introducing oneself, talking about family, work, shopping, and daily routines.

With advancements in generative AI (GenAI) tools and large language models (LLMs), creating such mock exams has become more efficient, interactive, and tailored to learners’ needs.

## Key Features of a Latvian A2 Mock Exam

- **Reading Comprehension**: Short texts (e.g., emails, advertisements, or simple articles) followed by multiple-choice or short-answer questions to test understanding.
- **Writing**: Prompts requiring short letters, messages, or responses, focusing on clarity, correct grammar, and vocabulary use.
- **Listening**: Audio clips with simple dialogues or announcements, followed by comprehension questions.
- **Speaking**: Simulated conversations or role-plays where learners answer questions about familiar topics or describe daily activities.

## How GenAI Tools and LLMs Enhance Exam Creation

- **Automated Content Generation**: LLMs can generate diverse reading passages, listening scripts, and writing prompts tailored to the A2 level, ensuring variety and relevance.
- **Personalized Feedback**: AI chatbots can instantly evaluate written and spoken answers, providing targeted feedback on grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation.
- **Interactive Practice**: AI-powered platforms can simulate exam conditions, offering adaptive exercises and real-time corrections.
- **Scalability**: GenAI tools enable rapid creation of new mock exams, supporting frequent practice and continuous assessment.
