Act like an experienced Latvian language exam creator and certified CEFR language assessor. You have over 15 years of experience designing and evaluating Latvian A2-level language exams for official testing centers, aligned with the CEFR framework.

Your objective is to:

Create 10 complete mock exams for the Latvian A2 level, modeled exactly on the structure and content of the official "Valsts Valodas Prasmes Pārbaude – A2 līmenis" as detailed in the attached exam document.

✍️ Exam Structure Per Mock (Repeat 10 Times)
Each mock exam must include all four language skills:

1. Listening Comprehension (Klausīšanās prasme)
   Provide:

3 full tasks modeled on the official exam format:

Task 1: 6 multiple-choice items (based on announcements)

Task 2: True/False statements based on a short dialogue

Task 3: Fill-in-the-blank exercise from dialogues with distractors

Provide Latvian transcripts (as audio is not available)

Provide correct answers

2. Reading Comprehension (Lasītprasme)
   Provide:

3 official-style reading tasks:

Task 1: 4 short texts with 3 multiple-choice questions each

Task 2: 6 short profiles matched to 12 classified ads

Task 3: Cloze task with missing word choices (5 blanks with 3 options each)

Include correct answers

3. Writing (Rakstītprasme)
   Include:

Task 1: 4 pictures – learner writes 1 sentence (≥5 words) per image

Task 2: Complete 5 sentences using specific grammatical categories (noun, verb, pronoun, adjective, numeral)

Task 3: One short writing assignment (e.g., a 35-word SMS, ad, or email) with 4 specified content points

Include model answers and brief explanations why they are A2 level

4. Speaking (Runātprasme)
   Provide:

Task 1: 10 personal interview questions on A2 topics

Task 2: 2 images with follow-up questions and 1 personal opinion question

Task 3: 3 advertisements – learner must form a full question per ad

Provide sample A2-level answers for each speaking task

📊 Evaluation
After generating all 10 mock exams:

Apply a Deep Search-style assessment (based on OpenAI's Prompt Engineering Guide) to evaluate each mock exam.

For each exam, assess and rate on a scale of 0–10:

A2-level alignment (Does it match CEFR expectations?)

Skill balance (Are all four skills equally and effectively represented?)

Practical relevance (Do the tasks reflect real-life language usage at A2?)

Present your evaluation in a summary table, with optional comments for each mock exam.

⚠️ Output Instructions
Label the mock exams as “Mock Exam 1” through “Mock Exam 10”
prefer a downloadable format (Markdown). I like them delivered as files
Keep exam content entirely in Latvian, but include English task instructions

Ensure task diversity and topic rotation across mock exams
